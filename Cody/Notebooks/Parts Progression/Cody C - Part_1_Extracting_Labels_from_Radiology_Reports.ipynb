This is an important clinical task as it helps in the early diagnosis and treatment of various lung conditions.\n","\n","In order to train a model that classify pneumonia status given chest X-rays, we require a ***training set*** with chest X-rays and labels from radiology reports consistent of patient metadata. However, when working with real-world medical data, clear-cut important labels (e.g. \"pneumonia\") are often not annotated ahead of time. The only data that a researcher has access to are the raw images and free-form clinical text written by the radiologist.\n","\n","**Your First Task**: Given a set of chest X-rays and paired radiology reports, your goal is to use natural language processing (NLP) tools to extract the pneumonia label and relevant patient metadata from the reports.\n","\n","**Looking Ahead**: When you complete this task, you should have a training dataset with chest X-rays labeled with pneumonia status and other relevant patient metadata. You will later use this dataset to train a computer vision model that predicts the pneumonia class given an image."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_75WVQT-eRDT"},"source":["### Load Data"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["FOR GOOGLE COLAB"],"metadata":{"id":"x9V1VK9p4IBW"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"bP83_n0TXwTS","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":158},"executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1718991441380,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":403,"user":{"displayName":"Cody Chen","userId":"04636862374912145551"}},"outputId":"8d628488-d447-4c91-8c08-e1688abc2c4a"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"error","ename":"ModuleNotFoundError","evalue":"No module named 'google.colab'","traceback":["\u001b[1;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[1;31mModuleNotFoundError\u001b[0m                       Traceback (most recent call last)","Cell \u001b[1;32mIn[1], line 1\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m----> 1\u001b[0m \u001b[38;5;28;01mfrom\u001b[39;00m \u001b[38;5;21;01mgoogle\u001b[39;00m\u001b[38;5;21;01m.\u001b[39;00m\u001b[38;5;21;01mcolab\u001b[39;00m \u001b[38;5;28;01mimport\u001b[39;00m drive\n\u001b[0;32m      2\u001b[0m drive\u001b[38;5;241m.\u001b[39mmount(\u001b[38;5;124m'\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m/content/drive\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;124m'\u001b[39m)\n","\u001b[1;31mModuleNotFoundError\u001b[0m: No module named 'google.colab'"]}],"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"id":"cKbPbuLeXyDB","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1718905376064,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":802,"user":{"displayName":"Cody Chen","userId":"04636862374912145551"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import os\n","# TO DO: update this path to point wherever the `2024 AIMI Summer Internship -
